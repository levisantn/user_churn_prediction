# User churn project
___

## Overview

This project aims to prevent monthly user churn on the Waze app. By analyzing the provided dataset of user information and behavior, we seek to understand why users churn and build a predictive model to identify users at risk of leaving the platform.

## Features

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**Â Visualizing data to uncover patterns and relationships, identify key variables influencing churn and discover correlation between variables. 
2. **hypothesis Testing**: Conducting statistical tests to validate or reject hypotheses about factors affecting churn and identifying significant differences in user behavior.
3. **Regression Modeling:** Building logistic regression models to predict churn probability, evaluating model performance using relevant metrics, and identifying important predictors of churn.
4. **ML Modeling:** Exploring various machine learning algorithms for churn prediction, fine-tuning hyperparameters, comparing model performance, and selecting the best-performing model.

## Results

Detailed summaries of the results for each step can be found in the `results/` folder.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding user churn on the Waze app. While the predictive models require further development, the insights gained from EDA and hypothesis testing offer valuable insights for potential improvements.

Key areas for improvement include:
- Collecting additional data on user behavior and preferences.
- Investigating more complex machine learning algorithms.

In general, this project highlights the importance of understanding user behavior to prevent churn.

*This project demonstrates a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. The ability to effectively communicate findings and provide actionable recommendations is crucial for data-driving businesses.*
